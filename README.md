## Introduction 
Jazaredu is an open-source educational website to make you learn any field for free.

## How to write? 

We use markdown and Latex to write lessons. You can learn both from anywhere online or even use any editor to convert between them and vice versa.
We use special markdown to create custom components to make the topics more readable and pretty.

Here's a list of all custom components till now:

### Note
```
:::lesson-note
We are going to use the two terms ‘magnitude’ and ‘length’ interchangeably.

please keep :::lesson-note and ::: on separate lines to avoid any errors.

### Definition
```
:::lesson-def
You text here or maybe your LateX.

The term "salt factor" refers to the amount of the active ingredient present in a salt form compared to its non-salt form.

Only use this if you want to give more details but are not required so it will be hidden by default unless the user clicks on it.
