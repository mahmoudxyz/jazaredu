## Introduction:

In Python, if/else statements and conditional operators are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. They allow us to execute different parts of code based on whether a certain condition is true or false.

## if else Syntax

The basic structure of an if statement in Python is:



```
if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is True
```

The code within the if block is only executed if the condition is True. Otherwise, it is skipped and the program continues with the next line of code after the if block.

Please note that in Python, curly braces are not used for code blocks, and proper indentation is crucial. Failure to indent correctly will result in errors. Indentation can be achieved using spaces or tabs, but it is recommended to use either taps over spaces. Who use spaces ? Just one tap is enough.

If we want to execute some code when the condition is false, we can use an else block:


```
if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is True
else:
    # code to execute if condition is False
```

Here's an example:


```
x = 5

if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")

# output: x is less than or equal to 10
```

In this code, the condition x > 10 is `False`, so the code within the `if` block is skipped and the program executes the code within the `else` block.

## logical operators:

We can also combine multiple conditions using logical operators. Here are some of the most common ones:

`and`: Returns True if both conditions are True

`or`: Returns True if at least one of the conditions is True

`not`: Returns True if the condition is False, and vice versa

`For` example, we can use the and operator to check if a number is between two values:


```
x = 5

if x > 0 and x < 10:
    print("x is between 0 and 10")
else:
    print("x is not between 0 and 10")

# output: x is between 0 and 10

```

In this code, the condition x > 0 and x < 10 is True, so the code within the if block is executed.

## Nesting if statements:

We can also nest `if` statements to create more complex conditions. For example:

```
x = 5
y = 7

if x > 0:
    if y > 0:
        print("x and y are both positive")
    else:
        print("x is positive but y is not")
else:
    print("x is not positive")

# output: x and y are both positive

```

In this code, we first check if x > 0, and if it is, we check if y > 0. If both conditions are True, we print a message indicating that both x and y are positive. If only the first condition is True, we print a different message indicating that x is positive but y is not. Finally, if the first condition is False, we print a message indicating that x is not positive.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, if/else statements and conditional operators are fundamental concepts in Python programming. They allow us to make decisions and control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. It's important to remember that proper indentation is crucial in Python and that curly braces are not used for code blocks. Additionally, logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not` can be used to combine multiple conditions. By mastering these concepts, we can create more complex and robust programs in Python.
